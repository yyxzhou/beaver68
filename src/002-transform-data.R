# ==============================================================================
# 002-transform-data.R
#
# Purpose:
#   Turn the raw WRDS pulls into the event-window panel that Beaver (1968)
#   analyzed: for each annual earnings announcement, one row per trading
#   day from 20 days before to 20 days after the announcement, carrying
#   the return, the market-adjusted return, and trading volume.
#
#   The logic of the design, in one sentence: if earnings announcements
#   convey information, then volume and return variability should be
#   ABNORMALLY HIGH on day 0 relative to the surrounding non-announcement
#   days -- and each announcement acts as its own control.
#
# Based on:
#   The event-window construction -- the +/-20 trading day window, the
#   trading-day calendar, and mapping each announcement forward onto it --
#   follows Chapter 12 of Gow, I. D., and T. Ding. 2024. Empirical Research
#   in Accounting: Tools and Methods. Chapman & Hall/CRC. Read the chapter
#   alongside this file: https://iangow.github.io/far_book/beaver68.html
#
# Inputs (from RAW_DATA_DIR):
#   fundq-raw.parquet
#   ccm-link.parquet
#   crsp-dsf-v2.parquet
#   crsp-index.parquet
#
# Outputs (to DATA_DIR):
#   event-panel.parquet        One row per announcement per trading day
#   event-summary.parquet      Collapsed to relative_td x year x decade
#   trading-dates.parquet      CRSP trading-day calendar with td index
#   sample-selection.parquet   Step-by-step observation counts
#
# Notes:
#   - The heavy joins run in DuckDB directly against the parquet files,
#     so the ~100M-row CRSP daily file never enters R memory. Only the
#     small collapsed results get collect()ed.
#   - Every design choice Beaver made that we either match or deliberately
#     depart from is flagged with a "DESIGN CHOICE" comment. Those are
#     the raw material for the discussion questions in the write-up.

# DESIGN CHOICE (matches Beaver): annual earnings announcements only.
# Beaver's 1961-1965 sample period predates mandatory quarterly reporting,
# so his "earnings announcement" is an annual event. fqtr == 4 is the
# closest modern analogue: the Q4 report, which is when annual results are
# released. Set ANNUAL_ONLY <- FALSE to use all four quarters -- which is
# what Ball and Shivakumar (2008) do when they argue earnings
# announcements convey relatively little information.
ANNUAL_ONLY   <- TRUE

# DESIGN CHOICE (matches Beaver): NYSE-listed firms only. Beaver required
# NYSE listing partly for data availability and partly to get a set of
# firms with relatively few competing news events. Set to FALSE to include
# Nasdaq and NYSE American -- see the discussion question on how far
# Beaver's results generalize.

annc <- fundq_tbl |>

# Step 2: attach permno via the CCM link ---------------------------------------

# The CCM link is a HISTORY table -- one row per gvkey-permno pairing per
# validity period. The screens below are the standard ones:
#   linktype LC / LU / LS  research-grade links (drop dubious ones)
#   linkprim C / P         primary link (drop secondary share classes,
#                          which would otherwise duplicate every event)
# The date conditions keep only links valid ON the announcement date. A
# NULL linkenddt means "still valid today."

ccm <- ccm_tbl |>
  filter(linktype %in% c("LC", "LU", "LS"),
         linkprim %in% c("C", "P")) |>
  select(gvkey, permno = lpermno, linkdt, linkenddt)

# permno per gvkey-datadate, but a bad link table would silently duplicate
# every event and inflate the sample. Check rather than assume.

# Step 3: build the trading-day calendar ---------------------------------------

# THIS IS THE KEY IDEA OF AN EVENT STUDY and it is worth pausing on.
#
# We do not want CALENDAR days -- "20 days before the announcement" would
# straddle weekends and holidays inconsistently. We want TRADING days. So
# we take every date on which the market was open, sort them, and number
# them sequentially: td = 1, 2, 3, ...
#
# Now "20 trading days before" is just event_td - 20. Arithmetic on a
# gap-free integer replaces messy date logic.
#
# The market index file gives us exactly the set of dates the market was
# open, which is why we use it rather than deriving the calendar from
# individual stocks (a thinly traded stock has no observation on days it
# did not trade, which would punch holes in the calendar).

trading_dates <- index_tbl |>
  select(date = dlycaldt) |>
  distinct() |>
  arrange(date) |>
  collect() |>
  mutate(td = row_number())

message("Trading-day calendar: ", nrow(trading_dates), " days from ",
        min(trading_dates$date), " to ", max(trading_dates$date))

write_parquet(trading_dates, glue("{data_dir}/trading-dates.parquet"))


# Step 4: map each announcement to its event trading day -----------------------

# An announcement can land on a Saturday, a holiday, or after the close.
# We roll FORWARD to the next day the market was open -- that is the first
# session in which the market could actually react.
#
# What we need is a "rolling join": for each rdq, find the smallest
# trading date that is >= rdq. data.table and polars have this as a
# built-in; in base R the tool is findInterval() on the sorted vector of
# trading dates.
#
# WORKED EXAMPLE. Suppose the trading calendar around a weekend is
#
#   index:  ...   4            5            6           ...
#   date:   ... 2019-02-01   2019-02-04   2019-02-05    ...
#             (Friday)      (Monday)     (Tuesday)
#
# findInterval(x, vec) returns the index of the LARGEST vec value <= x.
#
#   rdq = 2019-02-04 (Monday, a trading day)
#       findInterval -> 5, and td_vec[5] == rdq, so the answer is 5.
#
#   rdq = 2019-02-02 (Saturday, not a trading day)
#       findInterval -> 4 (Friday, the largest date <= Saturday).
#       td_vec[4] != rdq, so we add 1 and get 5 -- Monday. Correct:
#       a Saturday press release is first tradable on Monday.
#
# That "add 1 unless rdq is itself a trading day" is exactly what the
# three lines below do, vectorized over all announcements at once.

annc_r <- annc_linked |> collect()

td_vec <- trading_dates$date

idx <- findInterval(annc_r$rdq, td_vec)

# Is rdq itself a trading day? (idx > 0 guards the case where rdq falls
# before the calendar even starts, when findInterval returns 0.)
is_trading_day <- idx > 0 & td_vec[pmax(idx, 1L)] == annc_r$rdq

# Roll forward one position when it is not.
event_idx <- ifelse(is_trading_day, idx, idx + 1L)

# An announcement after the last trading date in our calendar has no
# tradable day. Mark those NA; the filter below drops them.

# Step 6: build the Beaver measures --------------------------------------------

# THE TWO VARIABLES BEAVER LOOKED AT:
#
#   VOLUME. Beaver scaled each firm's announcement-week volume by that
#   firm's own average volume in non-announcement weeks -- so a large firm
#   that always trades heavily does not swamp a small one. We compute two
#   versions:
#     rel_vol  volume / that event's own mean daily volume  (Beaver's ratio)
#     turn     volume / shares outstanding                  (turnover)
#   Turnover is the modern convention and is comparable across firms and
#   across time in a way that raw volume is not. shrout is reported in
#   THOUSANDS of shares while vol is in shares, hence the 1000.
#
#   RETURN VARIABILITY. Beaver did not look at the LEVEL of returns -- an
#   announcement can be good news or bad news, so average returns wash out
#   to roughly zero. He looked at the DISPERSION of returns. We report the
#   standard deviation and the mean absolute return (the latter is far
#   less sensitive to a single outlier).

# Count events surviving the exchange screen BEFORE the minimum-
# observations screen, so the two appear as separate rows in the sample
# selection table. Collapsing them into one line would hide which screen
# actually costs you the observations -- and on this sample the exchange
# screen is by far the bigger of the two.
