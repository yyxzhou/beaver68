# Purpose:
#   The formal statistical tests that Beaver (1968) could not run.
#
#   This script exists because of one of the discussion questions. Beaver
#   assessed significance informally -- he counted how many firms showed
#   the predicted pattern and eyeballed the plots (pp. 77, 81-82). He had
#   good reason: in 1968 there were no packaged statistical routines and
#   computing was expensive. The question the exercise asks is "how would
#   you evaluate significance if you were writing this paper today?" and
#   this script is one answer.
#
#   The modern answer is a regression with an announcement-window
#   indicator, firm and calendar fixed effects, and standard errors
#   clustered on both firm and date. Every one of those pieces addresses
#   a specific way the informal approach could mislead you, and the
#   comments below say which.
#
# Inputs (from DATA_DIR):

# Build the regression variables ------------------------------------------------

# The dependent variables are Beaver's two measures:
#   abs_ret_mkt   absolute market-adjusted return  (return variability)
#   turn          share turnover                   (volume)
#
# The independent variables of interest are indicators for where we are
# relative to the announcement:
#   event_day     day 0 exactly
#   event_window  days -1 through +1, which catches announcements made
#                 after the close (the reaction lands on day +1) and
#                 leakage on day -1
#
# The omitted category is therefore "an ordinary non-announcement day for
# this same firm" -- which is exactly the comparison Beaver made
# informally, now made explicit.

# MEMORY NOTE. On the full 1970-2024 history this panel is ~3.4 million
# rows, and each fitted model below retains vectors as long as the data.
# Two habits keep the script inside a normal laptop's RAM:
#   1. select() down to only the columns the regressions actually use
#      before doing anything else;
#   2. rm() the full panel once regdata exists, then gc().
# Skipping these is what turns this script from "runs in two minutes" into
# "R session crashes with no error message."

# Table 3: the main regression --------------------------------------------------

# WHY EACH PIECE OF THE SPECIFICATION IS THERE:
#
# Firm-event fixed effects (`firm_event`). Each announcement is compared
#   ONLY against the other 40 days in its own window. This is Beaver's
#   "each firm is its own control" logic, imposed formally. Without it, a
#   firm that is simply more volatile than average could drive the result.
#
# Calendar-date fixed effects (`date`). Absorbs market-wide shocks. If
#   many firms announce on the same day and the market happened to move
#   that day, we would otherwise credit earnings for it.
#
# Two-way clustered standard errors (firm and date). The two ways these
#   data are NOT independent. Observations on the same firm are
#   correlated over time; observations on the same calendar date are
#   correlated across firms (common shocks). Ignoring either understates
#   the standard errors, sometimes by a lot. This is the single most
#   common way an event study overstates its own significance.

# We report the two outcomes in SEPARATE tables rather than one wide one.
# Six columns overflows the text width of a standard 1-inch-margin
# article, and the two outcomes are in different units anyway, so
# stacking them in one table invites the reader to compare coefficients
# that are not comparable.

# All models are fitted through this one helper, so the estimation
# settings stay identical across every column of every table.
#
# WHY lean AND mem.clean. By default a fitted fixest object keeps several
# vectors as long as the input data -- residuals, fitted values, the
# demeaned regressors. At 3.4 million rows that is a few hundred MB PER
# MODEL, and we fit ten of them. Without these two arguments R runs out
# of memory and dies with a segmentation fault and no error message,
# which is a genuinely awful thing to debug.
#
#   lean = TRUE       drop those large components after estimation.
#                     Coefficients, clustered standard errors, N, R2 and
#                     the fixed-effect flags all survive -- everything
#                     modelsummary needs for the tables below.
#   mem.clean = TRUE  garbage-collect during estimation rather than after.
#
# The trade-off: you cannot call predict() or residuals() on a lean model.
# We do not need to. If you extend the analysis and do need them, refit
# that one model with lean = FALSE on a subset of the data.
