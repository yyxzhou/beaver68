# 003-figures.R
#
# Purpose:
#   Reproduce Beaver's (1968) two headline figures on modern data, plus
#   comparisons by decade and by estimated market beta.
#
#   Beaver's paper made its argument almost entirely through PLOTS -- which
#   is unusual by modern standards and is itself one of the discussion
#   questions. The figures here are deliberately close to his in shape:
#   the x-axis is trading days relative to the announcement, and the story
#   is whether day 0 stands out from its neighbours.
#
# Based on:
#   The plots follow Chapter 12 of Gow, I. D., and T. Ding. 2024. Empirical
#   Research in Accounting: Tools and Methods. Chapman & Hall/CRC, which
#   builds the same two figures. Read the chapter alongside this file:
#   https://iangow.github.io/far_book/beaver68.html
#
# Inputs (from DATA_DIR):
#   event-summary.parquet    relative_td x year
#   decade-summary.parquet   relative_td x decade
#   beta-summary.parquet     relative_td x beta quartile
#
# Outputs (to OUTPUT_DIR), each written as BOTH .pdf and .png:
#   fig1-volume.{pdf,png}            Beaver Fig. 1 analogue: relative volume
#   fig2-return-variability.{pdf,png} Beaver Fig. 6 analogue: return dispersion
#   fig3-turnover-by-decade.{pdf,png} Median turnover, by decade
#   fig4-variability-by-decade.{pdf,png} Return dispersion, by decade
#   fig5-observations.{pdf,png}       Sanity check: obs per relative day
#   fig6-turnover-by-beta.{pdf,png}   Median turnover, by beta quartile
#   fig7-variability-by-beta.{pdf,png} Return dispersion, by beta quartile
#
#   Use the .pdf files if you are writing in LaTeX (vector, scales
#   cleanly). Use the .png files if you are writing in Word.

# Pool across years for the two "Beaver" figures --------------------------------

# event_summary is one row per relative_td per year. For the headline
# figures we want a single line pooled across all years.

# NOTE the weighting. We cannot simply average the yearly averages --
# that would give a year with 800 announcements the same weight as one
# with 4,000. weighted.mean() with obs as the weight recovers the
# all-announcement average.

# NOTE: the weighted means must be computed BEFORE we collapse `obs`
# itself, and the result is given a different name (`n_obs`). Inside
# summarize(), later expressions see the values created by earlier ones --
# so writing `obs = sum(obs)` first would leave the weighted.mean() calls
# below trying to weight a 41-element vector by a single number.

# Figure 2: return variability ---------------------------------------------------

# Beaver's Figure 6. The key insight of his design: do NOT plot mean
# returns. An announcement is good news for some firms and bad news for
# others, so the mean is near zero whether or not the announcement was
# informative. Plot the DISPERSION instead -- if the announcement moves
# prices, it moves them in both directions, and dispersion spikes.
#
# We use mean absolute market-adjusted return. Beaver used a squared
# measure; the absolute version is far less sensitive to a single
# extreme observation, and one of the discussion questions asks you to
# compare the two.

# Figure 3: turnover by decade ---------------------------------------------------

# Beaver could only look at 1961-1965. We have five decades, which lets us
# ask a question he could not: has the informativeness of the earnings
# announcement changed over time?
#
# We switch to MEDIAN TURNOVER here rather than mean relative volume, for
# two reasons. (1) Turnover (volume / shares outstanding) is comparable
# across firms and across decades in a way that raw volume is not --
# market-wide volume has grown enormously since 1970. (2) The median is
# robust to the handful of enormous volume days that otherwise dominate
# a mean.
